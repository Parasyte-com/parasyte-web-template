    <h1>P2P Connectivity</h1>
    <p>
      Enable direct, secure communication between devices using Peer-to-Peer
      (P2P) networking. This architecture reduces latency, enhances privacy, and
      improves performance by bypassing centralized servers when possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our P2P implementation supports encrypted data transmission, NAT
      traversal, and automatic fallback to relays when direct connection is not
      feasible. Itâ€™s perfect for remote sessions, data sharing, or
      device-to-device coordination in IoT environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system includes advanced session management, retry logic, and peer
      discovery protocols, ensuring resilience and adaptability in any network
      condition.
